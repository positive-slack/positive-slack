Summary: I refactored my existing blog and move it to Pelican.

My previous version of the blog used [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and it was quite tedious for me to deal with Ruby ecosystem. So I had decided to find something more suitable for me and found [Pelican](https://getpelican.com/), which is also a Static Site Generator but written in Python.

So here it is - my blog version 2.0! Now it is much simpler to configure, setup and fill it with content, so I hope it will facilitate me in getting new posts done.

Stay tuned!

P.S. Some usefull links that helped me a lot during blog refactoring:

Welcome to `positive slack` blog!

Here, I'm exploring and sharing insights on digital design and verification. At the moment, I'm focused on ASIC verification, so you can expect posts on things like SystemVerilog, UVM, Python, etc. While this is my main area, I might mix it up with some other related topics from time to time.

Links and feedback:

- [My Github](https://github.com/esynr3z)
- [Github Discussions](https://github.com/positive-slack/positive-slack.github.io/discussions/categories/feedback) to provide feedback (and store comments to posts)

P.S. The main language used here is English, but sometimes articles in Russian may appear.

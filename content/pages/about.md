Title: About
Status: published

Welcome! Here I'm just trying to reflect, organize and, of course, share my knowledge.

My area of expertise is desing and verification of digital hardware (ASIC/FPGA) and all things involved into this (SystemVerilog, UVM, Python, etc.).

Main used language here is English, but sometimes there may be articles on Russian.

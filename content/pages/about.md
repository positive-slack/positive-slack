Welcome to `positive slack` blog!

Here, I'm exploring and sharing insights on digital design and verification. At the moment, I'm focused on ASIC verification, so you can expect posts on things like SystemVerilog, UVM, Python, etc in the first order. While this is my main area, I might mix it up with some other related topics (embedded, programming) from time to time.

Feel free to leave any feedback via [Github discussions](https://github.com/positive-slack/positive-slack.github.io/discussions/categories/feedback).
